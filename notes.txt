Data Flow
    Need to have Bug Card with an active/inacitve state
    Map Through this for the Bug Page
    Need to have it set up to clear active card when on exit
    Bug Card Details View needs to have an onClick that resets the value - will need to pass down state (redux maybe)

Need to setup database
    Create a new Co Account
    Then have admin by default - then they can add new members through their own portal
    will need to have a connected list for accounts 

    Schema - Companies -> Admins -> Non-Admins 

Admins can assign bugs but regular cannot
Admins can view total data while regulars can view their assigned bugs and their completed bugs per day 

Bug Details
-> Add Bug should have name, urgency, due by, details, how to recreate bug
-> Close Issue button that will give a details of how resolved and date resolved (auto, can't be changed)
->
